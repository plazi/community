# How long does it take until a GBIF record is updated once the changes have made in TreatmentBank?
The DwC-A proper used for the transfer to GBIF is re-packed 5 minutes after the treatment changes are done translating to the flat HTML included in the DwC-A, and notification to GBIF goes out immediately after the archive is done (re-)packing.

How long GBIF take to come harvest the new or updates DwC-A is outside our domain of control, but usually it's less than 30 minutes.
