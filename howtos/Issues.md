**Then, use the search box and try to find a similar issue. Please, note that you can search on open and/or closed issues, or search by labels, which is extremely helpful. Keep in mind that a similar issue might have been solved and closed already.**

## If you can't find it, create an Issue

**After making sure that your issue wasn't reported and/or resolved before, proceed to create a new one.**

**Every issue needs a title and a body. Please, be concise and informative in the title, and explain in detail your question or suggestion in the body. It's helpful to provide screenshots and links to the \*.IMF or \*.PDF files (first is preferable).**

**It's very helpful to provide context to your issue by either assigning a responsible, or defining the labels. These can be used, in the future, to search and find specific issues.**
